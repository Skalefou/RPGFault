# RPGFault

### What is RPGFault ?
RPGFault is a 2D platformer / RPG made in C ++ with the SFML-2.5.1 library.

### Where can I download it ?
Actually, there isn't any final release. We, sometimes, may drop beta executables here : [Releases](https://github.com/Skalefou/RPGFault/releases "Releases").

### When will it be finished ?
We have no intention of rushing it, so we can't provide a date of when it'll be finished.

With that being said, you must know that the game is early-developpment stage.

### Where can I talk with you ?
You can come on our discord server here on the [Server](https://discord.gg/gyHYNmn "Server").

You must take a note tho, for the time being, the most majority of the members are french, so some may not speak english.

Moreover, actually the server is in early-stage too!

### How can I help ?
You can try t find bug and report them to us.

If you know how to code, you can also do some push request if you can improve the game in some ways.
